    "description": "Join volunteers at Code for the Carolinas as we help the [National Zoning Atlas](<a href=\"https://www.zoningatlas.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.zoningatlas.org/</a>) (NZA) team include North Carolina and South Carolina in their nationwide zoning atlas. \"The National Zoning Atlas aims to depict key aspects of zoning codes in an online, user-friendly map.\" The Atlas aims to provide data for better solutions in transportation, environmental, and especially affordable housing policy. This is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data. Even if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg</a>) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel. Meetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work. By the end of the session, both groups of volunteers are working together. We also contribute to the project through asynchronous work and informal work sessions. Meetings are on the Jitsi platform and the link is provided before each meeting.

How we interact with and adopt new technology is influenced by the decisions of UX designers/researchers and their understanding of what people need for technology to be useful.

Join WWCode Partner Specialist Staffing Group and our expert panel of technologists from across the tech industry to gain insight and confidence into understanding UX design. The speakers will share their professional path to UX design and research, what UX problems they are working to solve, and discuss the importance of diversity in UX design. *Why you should attend:* * Learn from experienced technologists how to approach UX in your development process with research and diversity in mind.\u00a0<br/>* Connect and network with other members of the WWCode community.<br/>* Get exposure to opportunities to work with the Specialist Staffing Group.\u00a0 *Meet the speakers:*\u00a0 * Haley Dean; Senior Recruitment Consultant, Computer Futures<br/>* Jen Blatz; Principal UX Researcher, BECU<br/>* Adrienne Guillory, MBA; Chief Operating Officer, Usability Sciences Corporation<br/>* Manu Kaligotla; Sr. Manager, Design Research, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. **\ud83d\udcbb This is an online event.

This is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team.

This is a multi-dimensional project grounded in data science with an end-goal of contributing to a nationally influential dataset. Our current work session activities focus on internet search and integrating data from multiple sources. The project as a whole has occasional opportunities for U/X and outreach and opportunities to learn about machine learning and natural language processing through the work of the NZA team. Volunteering on this project will provide excellent exposure to the foundations of civic data science, with a focus on GIS data. Even if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can learn more about the project on our [Slack Workspace](<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg</a>) in the #project-zoning-atlas channel. Meetings start with brief introductions. New volunteers are offered a personal orientation, often in a breakout room, while experienced volunteers get right to work.

At these bi-weekly sessions, Code for the Carolinas volunteers work together to complete our project of mapping pedestrian access features in Downtown Raleigh.

This project is a partnership with the [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at the University of Washington](<a href=\"https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/</a>). The project involves using aerial imagery to code maps and metadata about features that make streets accessible to pedestrians--especially features that are important for pedestrians who face barriers to mobility and use wheelchairs or walkers.
